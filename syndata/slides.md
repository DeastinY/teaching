# Synthetic Data in Healthcare
*SOTA, Tools and Methods*


(Last Update: 20.11.2024)

---

>This slidedeck is mostly based on the publication "Synthetic data generation methods in healthcare: A review of open-source tools and methods" by C. Pezoulas et al., published December 2024 in the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.

### What is synthetic data?

EHR, wearable devices, genomic sequencing, imaging, telemedicine, ... vast amount of data is generated.

As it is sensitive data, there are significant obstacles in using them though!

Synthetic data **mimics** real-world data without the privacy issues.

---

### Additional benefits of Synthetic Data

- Data can be skewed or underrepresented ...
- ... with harmful bias (age, race, gender, ...)
- Synthetic Data can mitigate these biases

---

### What is Synthetic Data Generation?
- AI requires unbiased, large amounts of training data
- This data is often hard to get, especially in healthcare
- **Data Scarcity:** few data is available for rare conditions
- **Privacy Concerns:** data can often not easily be shared

---

### Goal of this paper:

Explore synthetic data generation techniques in healthcare
